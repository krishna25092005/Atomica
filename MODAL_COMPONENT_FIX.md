# Modal Component TypeScript Error Fix

## Issue
The Vercel build was failing with a TypeScript error:
```
Type '{ id: string; title: string; content: Element; onCloseText: string; }' is not assignable to type 'IntrinsicAttributes'.
Property 'id' does not exist on type 'IntrinsicAttributes'.
```

This error occurred in `src/components/ComponentHeader/ComponentHeader.tsx` at line 41.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by improper Modal component import and usage:

1. **Wrong Import**: `ComponentHeader.tsx` was importing `Modal` from `@/app/ui/modals/page`
2. **Page vs Component**: The `page.tsx` file is a Next.js page component, not a reusable component
3. **Missing Export**: The Modal component was defined inside the page file but not exported
4. **Type Mismatch**: The imported component didn't match the expected Modal interface

## Solution

### 1. Created Separate Modal Component
- Created `src/components/ui/Modal.tsx` with proper TypeScript interface
- Defined `ModalProps` interface with required props: `id`, `title`, `content`, `onCloseText`
- Implemented reusable Modal component with proper prop handling

### 2. Updated Imports
- Changed `ComponentHeader.tsx` import from `@/app/ui/modals/page` to `@/components/ui/Modal`
- Updated `src/app/ui/modals/page.tsx` to import and use the new Modal component

### 3. Fixed Component Structure
- **Before**: Modal component was embedded inside a page component
- **After**: Modal is a standalone, reusable component that can be imported anywhere

## Files Modified
- ✅ `src/components/ui/Modal.tsx` - New reusable Modal component
- ✅ `src/components/ComponentHeader/ComponentHeader.tsx` - Updated import path
- ✅ `src/app/ui/modals/page.tsx` - Updated to use new Modal component

## Benefits
- ✅ Resolves TypeScript compilation errors
- ✅ Creates reusable Modal component for the entire application
- ✅ Follows proper component organization patterns
- ✅ Enables successful Vercel deployment
- ✅ Maintains all existing Modal functionality

## Verification
- ✅ TypeScript compilation: `npx tsc --noEmit` passes without errors
- ✅ Component props match expected interface
- ✅ Modal functionality preserved in both ComponentHeader and modals page
- ✅ Ready for Vercel deployment

The application should now build successfully on Vercel!
